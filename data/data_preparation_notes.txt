The following tracks the preparation of the dataset for our 2024 USRA project.
- The raw dataset was downloaded from SurveyMonkey as .csv files (one with the numerical values and one with the actual answer text.
- The Prolific IDs were removed from the datasets and replaced with randomly generated IDs in a new column "ID".
- Both of these raw datasets were added to the repository as "./data/raw_anon_data_num.csv" and "./data/raw_anon_data_ans.csv". The latter will sit in the repository only for reference to how the numerical values in the former match up to the scale response items.
- Then, the file "./data/prolific_participant_processing.csv" was added to the repository. This file includes all of the (anonymized) IDs that are to be removed from the dataset before analysis, along with which round they were recruited on Prolific and the reason for their exclusion.
